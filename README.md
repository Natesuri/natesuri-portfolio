In this repo my goal is to migrate my Portfolio from Plain Old JS / Bootstrap Template to React.

This Repo: https://github.com/Natesuri/natesuri-portfolio

Current (old) Portfolio Site: https://natesuri.github.io/

Repo: https://github.com/Natesuri/Natesuri.github.io

The main reasons for switching to React.
- Routing
    Sometimes I want to send some people directly to my projects page.
- Cutting the fat
    The only part of the old site that uses a template is the nav bar, which is from a bootstrap template.
    Why use bootstrap or a template at all if it's only to render a nav bar?
- Better Product / Consistent Codebase
    I started building this portfolio before I was a very confident programmer, and I finished it in a rush (so that I could start looking for work). It's time to build an portfolio that looks like the real deal, both in the UI and under the hood: Not something made on the fly.
- Challenging Myself
    Bootstrap has it's advantages, but now that I'm comfortable with flex and a font-end ~~framework~~ library like React, I can make a portfolio without it. And I hope to do so as quickly as possible.
